CHANGES:
0.8.5 -> 0.8.6
- Initial support of WP Mac 2.x documents (Fridrich)
- Fix an alignment bug where alignment was propagated from multicolumn
  sections into following single column sections (Fridrich)
- Initial conversion of headers/footers in WP42 parser (Fridrich)
- Fix some parser errors in WP42 parser; now we seek to the right place
  and parse correctly all functions (Fridrich)
- Fixed crash in wpd2foo if invoked with non-existing filename (Jody Goldberg)
- Assure that the table we send to the listener implementation is a valid
  table independent of how messy the table is in the WP document (Fridrich)
- Fix situations where there is no tab position information in WPUs inside
  the tabulator function; the fallback works now even if the position is 0
  like in WP6 for DOS documents.
- Try not to crash under any circumstance by sanitizing the code and throwing
  exception in illogical, but in WP documents very real, situations (sum1,
  Fridrich)
- Make every implementation of WPXInputStream that we use return !0 if a seek
  fails; be more paranoiac with the result of read functions (sum1, Fridrich)
- Ignore corrupted prefix packets in WP5 documents (Fridrich)
- Try to convert as much information as possible even in corrupted WP3, WP5 and
  WP6 documents (Fridrich) - Libwpd now converts many documents that make crash
  WordPerfect itself.
- Fine-tune the WP42 document detection. Detect as many WP42 files as possible
  while still discarding plain text documents (Fridrich, Marc)
- Let the WP6 parser not die if the prefix packet it refers to is corrupted or
  absent (Fridrich)
- Fix hangs while parsing a corrupted WP6ExtendedDocumentSummaryPacket (sum1,
  Fridrich)
- General improvement of libwpd's conversion-success-rate and extensive QA with
  more than 46'000 real life documents (Mr. SUM1)

0.8.4 -> 0.8.5
- Conversion of font face, size and colour in WP5 parser, including the
  default font information (Fridrich)
- Conversion of foot/endnotes in WP5.x format (Fridrich)
- Conversion of headers/footers in WP3 and WP5 parsers (Fridrich)
- Prevent negative paragraph margins due to page margin change.
  Removes the ugly text-border lines running across the text in
  OpenOffice.org (Fridrich)
- Make page margins constant between two hard page breaks (Fridrich)
- Convert page margin changes into section margins in multi-column sections
- Move absolute position values in multicolumn sections from whatever column
  they are in into  the first one. Fixes the off-page position of the second
  table in 05mechanicalservice.wpd (Fridrich)
- Defer page span change to the end of the current paragraph if it is
  opened in order to prevent a paragraph break where it is not there in the
  original document (Fridrich)
- Fix http://bugzilla.abisource.com/show_bug.cgi?id=10105, an incorrect
  conversion of table alignment in WP3.x file format (Fridrich)
- Fix small issue with incorrect number of pages in page-spans (Fridrich)
- Fix an issue with "==" operator for WPXPageSpan classes. The result is now
  the same independent on the order of the operands (Fridrich)
- Fix http://bugzilla.abisource.com/show_bug.cgi?id=10279, a crash if a table
  from the middle of the tableList is in footnote and/or endnote (Marc, Fridrich)
- Add an option "--info" to wpd2text; called with this option, wpd2text dumps the
  information of the document instead of converting it. This could be useful for 
  beagle (Fridrich)
- Refactoring of the listener structure and split of WPXListener into WPXContentListener
  and WPXStylesListener (Fridrich, Marc and Cyrille Moureaux as a guest star)
