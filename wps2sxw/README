INSTALLATION:

Installation on Unix/Linux should be simple. Simply execute the following 
sequence of commands:

./configure ; make ; su -c 'make install'

Note that this assumes that you have development versions of libwpd
(>= 0.8.0), and libwps (>= 0.1.0) installed. I also assume that
you have pkgconfig installed.

This will make + install a single executable: wps2sxw. You may use it
on the command line as follows:

USAGE:

wps2sxw <infile> <outfile>

Where <infile> is a MS Works document and <outfile> is the name of
the target sxw document, which wps2sxw will create.

TROUBLESHOOTING:

You may need to add libwps's pc to your pkgconfig path, if
/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig is not present. Try setting this environment
variable on the commandline (using bash):

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/
